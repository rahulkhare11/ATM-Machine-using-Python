# ATM-Machine-using-Python

This project is a text-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation built using Python and SQLite. It provides users with a virtual ATM experience, allowing them to create accounts, log in, perform various banking transactions, and manage their account details. The simulation implements core functionalities such as balance checking, depositing and withdrawing money, generating mini statements, updating PINs, and more.
