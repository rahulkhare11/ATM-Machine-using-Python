# ATM-Machine-using-Python

This project is a text-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation built using Python and SQLite. It provides users with a virtual ATM experience, allowing them to create accounts, log in, perform various banking transactions, and manage their account details. The simulation implements core functionalities such as balance checking, depositing and withdrawing money, generating mini statements, updating PINs, and more.

# Features

1. User Account Management: Create user accounts with initial balances and 4-digit PINs.

2. Secure Log-In: Users can securely log in with their User ID and PIN.

3. Transaction Handling: Perform deposits and withdrawals while maintaining accurate balances.

4. Mini Statements: Generate mini statements showing recent transaction history and current balance.

5. PIN Update: Users can update their PINs for enhanced security.

6. User-Friendly Interface: Clear and user-friendly text-based interface for easy navigation.

7. Data Persistence: Utilizes SQLite to store user account information and transaction history.

8. Personalization: Displays the user's name in mini statements and messages.
